DZone recently published it's 2015 guide to code quality and software agility
Amidst the findings were 4 key takeways, summarized below with my own observations

(1) The definition of software quality changes depending on customer needs

**DZone Recommendation:** Software teams should follow the industry trend toward more testing for larger, more established products, and focus on speed of innovation for newer products.

**Reaction:**

(2) Technical debt worsesns when legacy code refactoring isn't a priority

**DZone Finding:** 61% of respondents say they have been limited in their ability to write automated tests because they needed to rewrite legacy code before they could write the tests.

**DZone Recommendation:** The longer organizations put off refactoring their legacy code, the more harmful the technical debt will become. Make refactoring legacy code and building automated tests for it a priority. 

(3) Developers can test, but most can't replicate the value of pure testers

Recommendations: Developers can manage testing in many low-maturity organizations, such as startups, but as a software productâ€™s customer base grows, the increased expectations for low-defect software necessitate having dedicated, skilled testers on the team. 

(4) The type of software product can determine whether more focus shoudl be on up-front testing or monitoring
