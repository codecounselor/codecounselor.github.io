## Welcome to CodeCounselor.org!

_Code Counselor_ is an idea conceived of as a result of over a decade of work in the software development industry.  The purpose of this site is to offer pragmatic insight and advice to anyone tasked with delivering production quality software.

### About the Author

I am the father of three wonderful children and husband to an amazing wife.  If it was not for their support I would have missed out on a number of great experiences throughout my career, which has led to the launch of this initiative.

My technical background is in enterprise systems on JVM technologies.  I no longer am apt to call myself a 'Java Developer' because I have discovered that a a great software craftsman must be capable of learning and deciding when to use the appropriate tools; including a diverse set of languages.  I am drawn to the challenge of finding, evaluating, learning, and leveraging the right technologies across broad problem domains.

By my observations, there is no better time than now to be in the field of software development.  Our field is one that [values openness and sharing](https://youtu.be/vhYMRtqvMg8), as demonstrated by the plethora of Open Source Software projects.  I believe our field is relatively unique in this regard, and with such a strong ecosystem it will be one that sustains itself for a long time.

Thanks for visiting, and please [reach out to me](mailto:codecounselor@gmail.com) and share your own thoughts or ideas!
